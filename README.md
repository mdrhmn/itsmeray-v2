  itsmeray v2.0
</h1>

This is the second iteration of my [personal portfolio & blog site](https://itsmeray.com/) built using Gatsby and hosted on Netlify.

Disclaimer: I did not build this entire site from scratch. Instead, I used [Ramón Morcillo](https://github.com/reymon359)'s open-sourced website which was built from the [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Technology Stacks

- **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/):** React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** Javascript library for building User Interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Microsoft's open-source Type-safe language that compiles to JavaScript.
- **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com):** CSS in JS Library for the styles.
- **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):** The query language used to access the data with Gatsby.
- **[ESlint](https://eslint.org/):** To find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. Although [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) was used to format files now the linter `fix` option does it.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions):** GitHub's Continuous Integration & Delivery tool.
- **[Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/):** Free, open-source app to automate the update of dependencies.
- **[GitHub Issues and Pull Requests Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates):** Templates to submit new Issues and Pull Requests.
