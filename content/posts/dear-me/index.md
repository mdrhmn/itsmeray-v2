# Dear Me

Have you ever wondered, **what if you’re able to meet up with your younger self?**

I have to admit, such thoughts had occurred inside my head far more frequent than I’d expected especially when I’m alone. The idea that you could potentially travel back in time and have a one-on-one conversation with a younger, more naïve version of you seems quite thought-provoking to me.

Of course, I consider myself to be somewhere between a realist and a pessimist. So to me, there’s nothing good that comes from dwelling on such a far-fetched hypothetical. **There is just no way I or anyone would be able to do time travel**.

But for once, I thought, _maybe_ this could be an exception. I try to convince myself and think of it as less of useless daydreaming, but more of an opportunity to self-reflect on my growth, experience and wisdom framed in a truly imaginary situation.

**So, let’s do that, shall we?**

But first, let’s establish some basic rules just to ground my imagination a bit. Let’s say if time travel is indeed possible, meeting up with your younger self won’t lead to some weird paradox. I’d like to think of it as more of an _Endgame_ type of time travel and not like _Back to the Future_ and other depictions of time travelling that imply severe repercussions to your present and future self for what has changed in the past. In other words, time travelling in our hypothetical will create a new branch of reality a.k.a. multiverse.

You can already tell from this point that even if this is just _pure imagination_, my realist side still tries to cover edge cases wherever possible (even though it’s honestly borderline futile).

Once we get that out of the way, I also need to decide how far exactly am I going to travel back… which is something I never considered in the first place. Now that I think of it, it’s rather difficult trying to decide how much younger of me that I want to talk to.

You know what, **fuck it.** Why limit myself to meeting with only 1 version of myself when I can meet up with more than that at different points in time? It’s _my_ imagination, so I can do whatever I want.

Hence, I’m going to meet with 4 of me’s:

1.  One from primary school
2.  One from high school
3.  One from my foundation studies in PASUM; and finally
4.  One from my freshman year at FCSIT UM

### Dear Primary School Me

Your _pointy_ eyebrows are an incredible asset, not a curse or product of some devilish worshipping like what some of your peers used to bully you for. You will grow accustomed to people staring at them occasionally when conversing for the first time instead of making eye contact.

You once worried about being late to puberty and not as tall as other guys of your age. While the former is somewhat true (I was a slightly late bloomer), I can assure you that you will grow to become above average in height, at least by Asian standards.

When asked about the cliche age-old question about your ambition by your teachers, you _naïvely_ answered that you wanted to be a scientist. While I regret to inform you that such ambition is unattainable for future you, I did graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. So, I guess you _could_ say that I’m a computer scientist(?), if you ignore all the _actual_ computer scientists in academia that might be offended by said claim.

While it took me great courage to bring this embarrassing moment into writing where the public may lay their eyes upon, that short stint of a childhood romance you had with your classmate? Guess what, that will end up becoming the **last time** you’ve ever been romantically involved with someone if that even counts as one. Sadly, your future self is terrible at both seeking love _and_ loving oneself. Why? Well, you'll figure it out when you grow up.

Finally, your handwriting still sucks big time. Wish you would’ve spent more time fixing it though at your age. You know what they say, **one should strike while the iron is hot**.

### Dear High School Me

No, you’re not diagnosed with autism or ADHD just because you can’t comprehend maths. You’re just bad at managing your time and priorities, while still exploring via trial and error what learning method works best for you. That being said, I’m forever indebted to you for not giving up on yourself despite failing Add Maths multiple times. Your resilience taught me a valuable lesson that I carried with me to this very day. That failure is imminent and it is how we learn from it that matters most. In the end, your perseverance did prevail. You defied everyone’s expectations by acing your SPM.

You’re ashamed that you were labelled by some of your peers and seniors as a ‘yes-man’. While the recalling of that memory still stings, I too have learnt from that experience. Rest assured, your future self can stand his ground very well and is not afraid of saying no. If anything, you’re becoming ever more stubborn, maybe _too_ stubborn to my liking.

Being involved in debate was life-changing. It made you a better orator, a better critical thinker and opened your eyes to what the world is really like beyond the confines of the pre-meditated narratives that school actively maintains. The concept of self-compartmentalisation that you learnt from your senior proved to be a useful nugget of wisdom that you will continue to employ for years as a catalyst for your professionalism.

You experienced many changes in ideas of what you want to be in the future. From reading law to pursuing engineering and finally IT. First off, it was a dumb idea to think going into law suits you just because you like debating when deep down you know you _suck_ at anything memory-intensive. Secondly, engineering is _terribly_ overrated (sorry, my engineering mates). Going into IT/CS was the right decision, and I must credit you for that.

Speaking of making the right decision, I would be remiss if I did not mention about the dilemma you faced after high school: choosing between your JPA scholarship and pursuing your passion. Trust me when I say this, the decision you made to go for the latter is hands down, the _wisest_ decision you’ve ever made. When 99% of people you consulted told you to stay, you were astonishingly defiant and bravely went against the tide. While you had to forgo your lifelong dream of pursuing your studies overseas and endure the pain and embarrassment for quite a while, it’s a worthy sacrifice indeed; one that you will not regret in the long run.

“_No yardstick for too much_” is not a sustainable self-governing principle to have, Rahiman. You will soon realise that there is _indeed_ a limit to how much you can do at a given time. Recall the first law of thermodynamics: **Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another**. You take some, you lose some. There is simply no way for you to win everything without neglecting something along the way.

Lastly, I must warn you that the journey that lies ahead will be _incredibly_ turbulent. The road from adolescence to young adulthood will test every understanding you have of yourself, others close to you and this temporary world itself. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

### Dear Pre-University Me

Out of all my previous selves, yours last the shortest with only a year of timeframe. And yet, the events that you went through in that short period are without a doubt the most life-altering with far-reaching, monumental consequences down the line.

Being in an alien place surrounded by strangers is uncomfortable, I know. Especially when your support system began dismantling itself in near-instant to almost being non-existent. 1 year felt never-ending as if you’re cursed to relive it in perpetuity.

I wish I could tell you that whatever you went through will come to pass. While that is true for the most part, the hardships you faced at this stage of your life will haunt you to this day. You've done unspeakable things to yourself. Things you'd never imagine yourself doing. The scars will remain forever embedded within you, both figuratively _and_ literally.

On the silver lining of things, this was also the time when my faith is at its strongest and that you’re closest to God, understandably due to the unprecedented circumstances you found yourself in. Went to the _surau_ early for prayers, reciting the Quran before and after each prayer, even volunteering as _bilal_ and _imam_ most of the time. I truly envy your level of piety, and I wish I could sustain it to this day. If anything, my credence is at its lowest now than ever before. I wonder, will it take another adversity of such scale for my faith to be restored to its glory days?

It is this very adversity that compelled you to try to express yourself through writing by making use of your good command of the English language. A habit that soon proved to be a reliable coping mechanism to this day.

Just like rainbow and sunshine succeed rain and thunder, **with immense pain, comes great enlightenment**. While I don’t dare to say that the pain was worth it (_for how could I endorse such a conclusion to anyone reading this?_), what I can say is that the trials and tribulations you encountered truly moulded you into the most resilient you’ve ever been.

And last but not least;

### Dear University Me

What can I say?

At the risk of sounding narcissistic, **I really couldn’t be prouder of you.**

All those years of life lessons, you took heed of them and made a vow to not repeat them. You made the courage to escape the bubble, make new friends and meet new people. No more trying to be a lone wolf like you did back in PASUM. Instead, you start to understand the value of walking together as opposed to walking alone. You will also grow to be more emotionally conscious and intelligent; a trait that will prove useful in the future.

That being said, as you slowly climb up the ranks, you will soon begin to realise that it can get pretty lonely at the top. Whether this is an inevitable side effect of success, _maybe_? I still don’t have a clear answer to that.

Your pursuit of friendship will lead to many disappointments down the road. The anguish and agony you felt back in PASUM made you vengeful and pessimistic, for a slight hint of disappointment and distrust will lead you to light up the torch and burn the bridges to ashes without slight hesitation or remorse. A testament to the aftermath of your trauma.

Some bridges are forever burnt beyond repair, while others, you will envisage, are possible and worthy to be mended. As time passes your heart will begin to heal and soften. You will soon realise that the path of vengeance leads to nowhere.

Your unabashed quest for success, however, comes at a heavy price that will take a toll on your health. Your trait as a hard worker will eventually evolve into chronic workaholism. We’re talking skipped meals, irregular sleep (if any), and pill after pill of _Panadol_ swallowed to make the frequent headaches bearable. While it seems tempting to live like this just because it works, **it doesn't have to be this way.** There _does_ exist a sustainable equation of success with a balanced, healthy work ethic.

Always remember this adage from Henry David Thoreau:

“_I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not,_ **_when I came to die, discover that I had not lived at all_**_._”

As a wrap to not only my letter to you but also to this writing, I say this:

Enjoy your university life while it lasts. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Working, adult life–while it has its own perks–is lonely and repetitive, with no clear ending. So, put aside all that ego, **cherish every moment and make them count**.
