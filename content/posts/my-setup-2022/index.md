The following are the list of peripherals I used for my main setup:

- Xiaomi 34" Mi Curved Gaming Monitor
- LG 27" 27GL850 Monitor
- 2018 iPad Pro 10.2"

- Fifine K658D Microphone
- Edifier R1855DB Speakers

Because I work at Dell, they were also kind enough to send me a new laptop, monitor and other peripherals for my onboarding:
